#Motivations
Program analysis, generation and transformation are useful techniques that can be used in many situations:
* Program analysis ,which can range from a simple syntaxic parsing to a full semantic analysis,can be used to find 
potential bugs in applications,to detect unused code, to reversing engineer code,etc.
* Program generation is used in compilers. This include traditional compilers, but also stud or skeleton compilers used
for distributed programming, Just in Timer compilers,etc.
* Program transformation can be used to optimize or obfuscate programs, to insert debugging or performance monitoring 
code into applications,for aspect oriented programming,etc.

All this techniques can be used for anu programming language,but this is more or less easy to do ,depending on the 
language.In the case of Java,they can be used on Java source code or on compiled Java classes.One of the advantages of
working on compiled classes is that, obviously, the source code is not needed.Program transformations can therefore be 
used on any applications,include closed source and commercial ones.Another advantage of working on compiled code is that
it become possible to analyze, generate and transform classes at runtime.Just before they are loaded into the Java Virtual
Machine.The advantage is that tools such as stud compilers or aspect weavers become transparent to users.
